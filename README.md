# solving the build error with qt + gazebo gz-jetty

this repo demonstrates dependency hell due to build tools! jk

 its 2am. pls help me.


anyways, it basically runs cmake's find_package in a sample homebrew setup to see how you could run into an issue with it anchoring onto one package but then not finding the proper config file needed for a cmponent

this causes issues. many.
